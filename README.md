# Pipeline_For_Imputation
To achieve the useful and correct insights from the data we have focused on the data preprocessing stage. As we knew Our output quality is always depend on the input quality. So we have spent extra attention on data preprocessing. We can apply different techniques like Mean, Median, Mode/Most Frequent, Constant values but  here we have applied the Median technique for the numerical features and on the other hand we have applied Mode / Most frequently technique for the categorical features. We have created the automated pipeline to fill the Na/ missing values. While handling the missing values we have to take care of the actual distribution of the data set. Note: This is only for learning and practice purpose.
